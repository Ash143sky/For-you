        <h1>Dear [Rei],</h1>
    <p>
            I want you to know that no matter what life throws our way, you can always count on me. Life can be unpredictable, filled with ups and downs, but through it all, I'll be by your side. If you ever need someone to talk to, someone to listen, or just a friend to share a moment with, I will be here. Your struggles are my struggles, your joys are my joys, and your dreams are my dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember the times we've stayed up late, talking about everything and nothing? Those moments are some of my most cherished memories. They remind me of the deep bond we share and how fortunate I am to have found such a wonderful friend in you. Your resilience and strength inspire me every day, and your ability to find light even in the darkest times is truly remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Never doubt your worth or the impact you have on those around you. Your presence alone is enough to brighten anyone's day, and your compassion touches everyone you meet. I'm grateful for your friendship and for all the incredible moments we've shared. Here's to many more years of laughter, adventures, and heartfelt conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Rie, please always remember that I am here for you. Through every challenge, every victory, and every moment in between, I will be here, cheering you on and offering my unwavering support. Thank you for being such an amazing friend. I am so lucky to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all my love and gratitude,
        </p>
